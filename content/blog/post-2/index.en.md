Over the years many projects have accumulated that I have worked on. Until recently, I didn't even have an overview of the projects I had worked on over the last few years. One day I wanted to tidy up the "Projects" folder in my files a bit and sort out old files from the past. For this reason I created a folder for inactive projects. From the old files I could still find backups for some projects, which I then added to this folder structure. But some projects got a folder despite of not existing files. So I created a small overview of my previous projects a few weeks ago.

Due to the redesign of my homepage it was a good idea to make this overview available on a subpage. It was very interesting to look through old projects again and to get some more information about them. Of course, many things are forgotten over time. All the nicer that you can then remember these things through finds on the Internet. The Internet never forgets, unlike me.
