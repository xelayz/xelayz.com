As of today, the 9€ ticket is valid for unlimited regional travel throughout Germany. My experience with buses and trains is very limited, as I almost never took the bus to school as a child. Instead, I had to walk or ride my bike. Then, when I had my driver's license, my mobility behavior didn't shift to the car, but it really developed then. Since then, I have enjoyed driving long distances often.

Of course, I took the train much less often than the bus. I can't remember the last day I took a train. I was simply not a fan of being tied to fixed times and traveling with many people at the same time. In addition, the seats were also often uncomfortable, unless you bought a ticket for an ICE for a lot of money. But also the regional connections cost not a little money, which is why I then much preferred to drive my car. Nevertheless, the train offers something that my car can't offer me. In a train I don't have to drive myself and can devote myself completely to other things. In addition, the train runs much smoother and more evenly than a car. And that's exactly what I wanted to experience now on one of the longest regional routes. I will work, listen to music and sleep. And meanwhile, I'll get closer and closer to my destination until I close my notebook, get off the train and reach my destination: Cologne

My destination is Cologne, a big and partly beautiful city, where there are many delicious restaurants. Moreover, Cologne is the terminus of the longest regional and direct connection, which is connected to the station of my choice. The travel time for the outward journey is over 3 hours and is perfect to be able to devote completely different things.

Shortly after 9 o'clock I set off for the station. With me I had my small trekking backpack, which is much more comfortable than my normal backpack, which I usually carry everywhere. It made no sense to take the normal backpack with me, since I could not stow this evenly in the car, if this became too uncomfortable for me. In the backpack I still had my notebook, a jacket and something to eat and drink. Just before the station I noticed that in the train still the mask obligation applies. Unfortunately, I forgot to pack a mask and I would miss the train now if I go to my car again to get a mask. For this reason I then asked a cab driver who kindly sold me a mask for one euro. Shortly before the end of my trip I noticed that I had a mask with me. And this was even in the pockets of my sweater, in which I often had my hands. Well, it happened ...

Since my station is located pretty much at the beginning of the entire connection, the train was also accordingly empty and I was able to get a good seat at the window without any problems. The seats were actually not uncomfortable, certainly comfortable. This is probably due to the fact that the train was only put into service in 2019. I spent the first two hours of the 3-hour trip on my notebook, getting a few more things done. That went surprisingly well. The train rode very quietly and my notebook fit perfectly on the tray, which you could fold down in front of you. The ambient noise didn't bother me either, since I had headphones in my ears the entire time and listened to music. The rest of the hour I then leaned with my head against the window, closed my eyes and continued to listen to music.

The three hours went by quickly. Arrived at Cologne Central Station I have first lingered a few minutes on the track to orient myself at this large station and to wait for the flood of disembarking guests. My only goal was a restaurant, which but not hurry, because I have about 4 hours in Cologne available. I slowly walked through the station out to Cologne Cathedral. I already knew the area, but still it was always interesting to look at the cathedral, the train station and the surrounding buildings. Now I took my goal in the visor, which should be reached but via a small detour along the Rhine. Arrived at the restaurant I took the pizza-pasta-salad buffet there for only 11€. For 11€ it was okay, especially because you can eat as much as you can manage. Saturated I dawdled then further in the city center around. Along an older woman, who stood singing in the pedestrian zone and the lyrics of her "song" consisted only of weekdays, I came across a stand of the UN refugee aid. At first I did not notice the stand, because I was looking at the map on my smartphone, because I did not know where to go next. But then I paid attention to a girl who was desperately trying to recruit people for the UN refugee booth. I found it quite interesting how differently people reacted to the girl's attempts. Then our eyes met and she took this as an opportunity to approach me.

She told me that I didn't have to look at my smartphone anymore, because she was now with me. As a joke, I replied that I had actually been searching desperately for UN refugee aid all this time, but simply hadn't found it. So we started a conversation, which was only about the reactions of other people and that I like to listen to such things, no matter how much they interest me or not. Last year in Berlin I also liked to listen to the believers, even though I myself don't care much for religions.

Our conversation certainly went on for about 30 minutes. Their presentation about refugee aid, which was displayed on the tablet during the entire conversation, took up only a very small part of the conversation. Even when time was found for topics like body size, technology, and questions like "Are you musical?" for the presentation, she just clicked through it in a hurry. It almost seemed as if she would also much rather talk to me about everyday things than about the actual topic - refugee aid. Out of respect, however, I held back a bit on talking and gave her a chance to inform me further about the refugees. The goal of the people from the booth was to win people for an annual donation to the UN refugee aid. She then showed me a corresponding form on her tablet. However, I then told her that I unfortunately don't have any money left at the moment and that I am already doing my part for a better world and that I think it is important that everyone does at least one thing for it - be it just an annual donation.

We then got back to the everyday topics until we were interrupted by a woman who also belonged to the booth. She was much more direct and put it right there that I should please just fill out the form for the annual donation. It was for a good cause and it was an important issue. By doing this, she pulled me out of a very nice conversation and dragged me into a very stressful conversation. She didn't mince words and tried to make me feel guilty. I suspect that she overheard that I have been talking to the girl for a long time and so far the girl could not persuade me to donate anything. I guess she wanted to help the girl and steer us back to the real issue. However, I don't know what to make of this direct manner. On the one hand, it's not bad if people are persuaded to donate for a good cause. It's great when we have more money for important things. On the other hand, each person at the booth gets a commission for each successful donation, which is supposed to be an extra motivation to persuade people. And then that ruins the situation a little bit. Because I can't see what is driving the other person now. The commission or the help of the refugees. And if the woman is then also so direct and radically brings us back on course to the donation form, then it just feels wrong.

In the end, I made the compromise and showed interest in becoming active myself for refugee aid. In a separate form I let myself be registered and wait probably now for a contact attempt, in order to get further information. The woman then moved away again and the girl confirmed to me that she is sometimes very direct and does not mince her words. However, she does not mean that in a bad way. I perceived it as if she was just trying to help the girl finally get me to donate something. Slowly, I then wondered if the conversation was built solely on convincing me to donate or if parts of the conversation were really without ulterior motives. Because quite soberly considered it makes of course a lot of sense to bind the passerby about off-topic conversations, instead of just talking about the actual topic. That disappointed me then somewhat and I apologized for the fact that I stole her now over 30 minutes and it came to no donation. She then said that it was not bad at all and that after the nice conversation she could now gather new motivation to approach more passers-by. I said goodbye while already slowly moving away from the booth. Shortly before I wanted to turn around, the girl spoke to me again and wanted to know what her name was. I should actually know her name, because we introduced ourselves at the beginning of the conversation. But the question came so unexpectedly and my head was still busy weighing whether the conversation was meant seriously or not. I therefore had to pass and said that this is now really embarrassing. After another short goodbye, I turned around and went my way. It was funny that she asked me at the very end what her name was. Because I had already moved away from the booth and this question would not have changed my mind now to donate something. Maybe she just wanted to test me to see how serious I was about the conversation. Now we probably both believe that the other did not mean the conversation seriously.... By the way, her name was Franziska.

The clock showed already 15:30 and the Cologne city center filled more and more. Along the many stores I let myself drift again in the direction of the Rhine. Once there, I looked around a bit more until I made my way to the train station. My train should arrive in 40 minutes and I did not want to miss it. I also wanted to get a good position on the track to get a good seat on the train. In the end, however, I was standing completely wrong and the train went through to the end. But even though I was then one of the last people on the train, I was still able to find a good seat. In fact, the train offered so many seats that this then even seemed somewhat empty after all people had already taken a seat. So the stress before boarding was completely unnecessary.

I now have another 3 hours ahead of me again. This time I sat opposite to the direction of travel, since the only seats in the direction of travel were only in the 4-seat groups - at least in this area of the train. Unlike two girls who had to move for this reason, I didn't mind. However, it was a bit annoying that I was now teetering forward as soon as the train accelerated a bit more. Before, I was pressed into the seat instead, which was much more comfortable. When braking, I would be pressed into the seat, but the train always braked so moderately that it never really happened. I flipped open my notebook, turned on some music, and spent almost the entire 3 hours lying with my head against the window to doze a bit. During those 3 hours, I noticed that the train filled up significantly between some stations and sometimes it even happened that people were standing in the aisle. The people in the aisle disappeared pretty quickly, though, as many people only rode a few stations.

Shortly before my final stop, I noticed that the train was getting pretty empty and that the few people who were now still on the train must have gotten on at some point after Cologne. The two guys in front of me had also already gotten off. At the beginning of the journey I heard still, as one of the two asked the other, in which city it should go now next. The two then probably bought the 9€ ticket directly on the first day and decided on a trip to Cologne. The train slowly slowed down and reached my final stop. I packed my things and got off.

On this day, I have now ridden the train for a total of more than 6 hours and spent 4 hours in Cologne. I really enjoyed the two 3-hour rides and it's really great to be transported from A to B so quietly. The seats were not uncomfortable and it was good to do things on the notebook, sleep a bit or just look at the environment out the window. I would definitely take the train again for such long distances. The only thing that bothered me was that I couldn't decide for myself when I wanted to go. With my car, I can leave at any time and don't have to stick to any fixed times. However, I then have to drive the car myself and may get into a traffic jam. It has both its advantages and disadvantages and I would say that I like both very much. 

Price performance ratio of the 9€ ticket is of course unbeatable and gets a 10/10 from me! Small fun fact: Even though the 9€ is already pretty cheap, I managed to pay even less: My bank had a promotion a month ago where every customer got a 15€ rail voucher as a gift. And this voucher then paid for my 9€ ticket.
