The evening before sunny but cold weather was announced for the next day. As a result, I decided to ride my bike. Unfortunately, the next day I could not see the sun, because the fog had covered it. I had almost finished with my little trip, when then at about 14 clock but the sun appeared. Unfortunately, it is currently very quickly dark, so I quickly went with my car, in which the bike was stowed inside, to the desired location - a mountain in my hometown.

Accepted at the mountain has addressed me a mountain biker while unloading and noticed that I'm but late. 'Unfortunately yes, because I was just still uncertain with the weather' - I replied. Then I set off and continued up the mountain. Unfortunately, it was a bit too warm, so the paths were very muddy and not icy, as I had hoped. For this reason, it then only continued at a moderate pace, until I then gradually noticed what beautiful scenery awaited me further up the mountain.

It felt like I was on the top of a 4000 meter peak, which is completely covered in clouds. The valley, which only has about 100 meters of elevation difference from the mountain, was completely engulfed in fog. In addition, the sky was cloudless and a sunset was taking place. A beautiful natural spectacle, which was also admired and photographed by other people. Partly it also felt as if you were in an airplane from which you would just watch the sunset. The completely cloudless sky above us quickly made us believe that we were actually at an altitude where the real clouds were moving below us. Attached are a few pictures of this little miracle.
