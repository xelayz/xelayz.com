It is quite time consuming to write down any exciting experiences. Often I just don't want to leave out any details, which makes the blog entry longer and longer. At some point, I then easily lose track and proofreading then also brings only limited something, because I read over even quite obvious spelling **erors**. Because I have already read my text so often that I know it almost by heart. Thus one reads the individual words no longer so exactly and gives the errors a chance. So the error correction becomes a bit time-consuming and I just think to myself that somehow I don't feel like doing that. I just wanted to write down the experience.

For this reason I have now added another subpage. On this subpage I also share my experiences, but without much blah blah. The focus is rather on a single picture, which was taken during an experience and I particularly liked. Pictures say more than a thousand words, but these 'more than a thousand words' do not cover all words. Therefore there will be further blog entries.
