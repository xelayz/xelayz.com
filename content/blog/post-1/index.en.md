Today I finally managed to finish the new design for my site xelayz.com. For a long time there was nothing under the domain xelayz.com, then from time to time smaller projects and in the end a page made of simple html, css and js code to not let the domain run completely into the void. There were already the subpages where I linked recommendations and my services.

Now, in addition to the new design, more information and subpages were added. Among other things, my own blog, through which I can share everything that currently occupies me. Of course I know that this page doesn't really have visitors here, but it's still nice to publish one's thoughts and experiences here in an orderly fashion.

Each blog post will consist of a title, a description, the actual text and, every now and then, pictures. Additionally, I try to create some order with meaningful tags under each post.
