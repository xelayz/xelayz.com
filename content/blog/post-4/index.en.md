Hello and welcome to December 2021!

Every now and then it happens that I'm interested in a new insurance, but in the end I can't or don't want to take it out. This was the case a few months ago. At that time, I then obtained corresponding offers, some of which were sent by mail. This was not a big deal for me and was perfectly fine. In the end, however, I decided not to take out this insurance. This I have only quietly and secretly decided for me and left the provider in ignorance. For this reason, the provider then took me on as a potential interested party and after a few weeks I then received regular mail with the approximate wording of "Hey, you! Why don't you take out your insurance now, which you were interested in a short time ago! Enclosed also directly the application forms, go!".

After the third letter, it got on my nerves, especially since it is simply unnecessary garbage. From the newsletter via mail one knows it that at the end of most advertising mail a link is contained to the unsubscribe of the advertisement. Therefore, I also looked at the bottom of my physical advertising mail and found instructions to stop future advertising via mail. For this, I only had to formulate my cancellation to a mail address and the matter was done.

After a few days I received the confirmation of my revocation (although strictly speaking it is not a revocation, since this requires prior consent to receive the advertising). In addition, the provider then kindly sent me another piece of information, which really helped me and probably also helps the provider somewhat in the administration. A win-win situation - or not?

We are talking about the "DDV Robinson List". This list is maintained by the association "Deutscher Dialogmarketing Verband e. V." and contains addresses of all persons and their preferences regarding advertising mails via post. Every person is free to sign up for this list, in order to end up not receiving any more advertising from companies that make use of this list. Very practical from my point of view!

However, I have small data protection concerns: The list with about 950,000 addresses (as of June 2018) is maintained by the above-mentioned association and must then also end up with the corresponding companies, which then refrain from advertising. Unfortunately, I did not find any information on the DDV website about how exactly the information exchange with the companies takes place. For this reason, I asked how exactly the exchange takes place. I had asked whether the list is made available to the companies in plain text or whether the matching of the data from the list with the companies' data is done in encrypted form using, for example, zero-knowledge proof. This would be entirely possible, since the companies are only allowed to work with the data they already have in their own systems anyway. So it is completely unnecessary and inappropriate for DDV to share the full list in plain text with the companies.

Unfortunately, I only got a very superficial answer, which did not really answer my question. My query about it was then ignored. A further query was then promptly answered by the managing director, who, however, answered evasively and only referred to the fact that the transport takes place in encrypted form when sharing the list with the companies. However, this should be standard and does not require any special emphasis. In addition, I am told that the file is encrypted via AES-256 before it is sent. Fair enough, but I would then consider this more of an extended transport encryption, as the companies at the other end will still receive the list in plain text as they decrypt the file upon receipt.

The idea to reduce spam in the mailbox via such a list is really good, but the implementation needs improvement. In the end, everyone has to decide for themselves whether they want to be listed or not. I myself have made the compromise that now also companies have my address, which did not have it before, to stop possible mailbox spam.
