After visiting the Leipzig Zoo, I just had to visit the Panorama Tower Restaurant. Enjoying my meal with this view was really a nice experience. Alone among older people with noble clothes and me in my Adidas shorts. Was just warm and a noble suit is not yet part of my wardrobe.

Made good use of the exchange rate and ordered premium sushi, which would have been way too expensive for me in Germany. This sushi was perfect and ranks right behind my favorite, the sushi from Henssler&Henssler.

Alright. Do I have now also my typical photo with the bastion. A Ukrainian woman was also there alone and asked if I could take a photo of her. She returned my favor and took a photo of me too. Дуже дякую.

First time at a festival. Cool setting and some good performances in parts. Was definitely worth an experience. When asked if I needed something to "pull", I thought of weed and declined. Was only enlightened afterwards that coke was meant.
